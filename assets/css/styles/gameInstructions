<h1>Key Components to Expand</h1>
<p>Move Validation: Checkers move diagonally.</p>    
<p>Implement checks to ensure pieces only move to valid adjacent dark squares.</p>
<p>Capture Logic: If an opponent's piece is in an adjacent square and the square beyond it is empty, "jump" over it to capture.</p>
<p>Kinging: When a piece reaches the opposite end of the board, upgrade its status to "King" to allow backward movement.</p>
<p>Turn Management: Use a variable (e.g., currentPlayer) to restrict clicks to only the active player's pieces.</p> 

<! 2. Creating a 2D Array Grid
If you need to store data for each square (like a real board game), you can initialize a two-dimensional array. 
javascript
const size = 8; // 8x8 board
const board = [];

for (let i = 0; i < size; i++) {
  // Create a row (8 columns) and fill it with null or empty strings
  board[i] = new Array(size).fill(null);
}

<! Accessing a square: board[row][column]
console.log(board);-->
